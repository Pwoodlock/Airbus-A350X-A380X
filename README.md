# Avionics Hardware Stack for the [Flybywire Simulations](https://flybywiresim.com/) "A380X" with future implementation for the "A350X" 
---


> [!NOTE]
The project repository is a place holder while the first module is under development.
Files will be released when they're ready.

## Overview


This project provides complete files for building custom avionics hardware compatible for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The goal is to create an accessible, high-quality hardware solution for flight simulation enthusiasts and communities.


Given the nature of the two types of Aircraft the modules are nearly identical to with each model of aircraft.  I will be focusing on the A350X for hardware design.

While this is a ongoing project,  I do this all in my own time as I have other commitments, so please bare with me while this builds into something more complete.  I will be releasing module by module, as and when, they're finished and tested 👨‍🚀



This project is open to anyone that would like to contribute towards any aspect following QA. 

The following modules are being actively designed and worked on:

- [ ] EFIS-CP Captains Side - "In Dev"
- [ ] AFS 
- [ ] RMP-1
- [ ] KCCU 1 & 2
- [ ] EFIS-CP First Officer "Revision of Captains Side"
- [ ] ECAM Control
- [ ] Dedicated WASM Module 
- [ ] Mobiflight Module 


- Overhead Modules and other cockpit parts to follow.
