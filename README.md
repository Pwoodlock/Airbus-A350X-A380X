## Overview

While this is a ongoing project, I do this all in my own time as I have other commitments (Young Family, Full time Job, Other projects). Please bear with me while this builds into something more complete. I will be releasing module by module, as and when, they're finished and tested 👨‍🚀

The following modules are being actively designed and worked on:

- [ ] EFIS-CP Captains Side - "In Dev"
- [ ] X-Plane 11 / 12 Plugin - "In Dev"
- [ ] Dedicated WASM Module using the opensource FlightSimConnector
- Overhead Modules and other cockpit parts to follow.
