# Avionics Hardware Stack for the [Flybywire Simulations](https://flybywiresim.com/) "A380X" with future implementation for the "A350X" 
---


## Overview


This project provides complete files for building custom avionics hardware compatible for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The goal is to create an accessible, high-quality hardware solution for flight simulation enthusiasts and communities.


Given the nature of the two types of Aircraft the modules are nearly identical to with each model of aircraft.  I will be focusing on the A350X for hardware design.

While this is a ongoing project,  I do this all in my own time as I have other commitments, so please bare with me while this builds into something more complete.  I will be releasing module by module as and when they're finished and tested.

> The project repository is a place holder while the first module is under development.
> Files will be released when they're ready.

This project is open to anyone that would like to contribute towards any aspect following QA. 

The following modules are being actively designed and worked on:

- [ ] EFIS-CP Captains Side - "In Dev"
- [ ] AFS 
- [ ] RMP-1
- [ ] KCCU 1 & 2
- [ ] EFIS-CP First Officer "Revision of Captains Side"
- [ ] ECAM Control


- Overhead Modules and other cockpit parts to follow.

## Getting Started

- KiCad 8.0.8 upwards
- FreeCad 1.0.0 upwards + KiCadStepUp plugin (Optional)
- Vectric Apsire Pro 12
- OpenBuilds Control Centre (My Choice of gcode sender) with GRBL R1.1
- MPS Designer (Not Essential)
- Visual Studio Code (Or your own IDE Preference) PlatformIO
- CNC Machine like a 3020 / 3040 or Co2 Laser Machine ( Currently all modules fit on the 3020 which is the CNC I currently own )
- 3D Printer, either it be FDM, or Resin etc I have have parts that will suit both fabrication methods hopefully.
- Gerber's for PCB Fab house and optional tooling for Pick & Place Machines etc.

## Features

- Complete hardware schematics and PCB layouts
- Microcontroller firmware for all module/s
- Mechanical designs for enclosures and mounting solutions for CNC & 3D Printing Fabrication
- USB interface with plug-and-play compatibility
- Mobiflight Module
- Future planned network connectivity implementation
- Compatible with FlyByWire Simulations' A380X
- Compability with other A350X Projects when they release.

## Contributing

I'll welcome any productive contributions from the community! Whether you're interested in:

- Hardware design
- Firmware development
- Mechanical design
- Documentation
- Testing and validation
- Technical Information regarding the A350X Series would be fantastic.
